# Bandit-1-2
Log back in as bandit1 your gonna see a file  called - located in the home directory.  To be able to look at it isn't gonna be the same as last time, instead, use /home/bandit1 so that you can get into it slightly diffent than how I used cat last round but was still easy if you did it right you should have the password for the next round
